## HTML Source Grabber

### Description

This grabs the source to web pages. I made this because there were a few pages that did some things that I was curious on how it was done and I couldn't view the source with conventional methods because the page would not allow it or it forwarded me on too fast. Since this just opens up a socket to the web server and dumps the data to a text box it is unaffected by the actual code on the page.
